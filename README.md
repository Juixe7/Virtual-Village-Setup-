## 🖥️ Computer Graphics Techniques Used

### 1. **Procedural Terrain Generation**
   - **Perlin Noise** for natural height variations
   - **Chunk-based LOD** for infinite world rendering
   - **Vertex Shading** for terrain color variation
   - **Geometry Instancing** for optimized rendering

### 2. **Advanced Lighting System**
   - **Directional Lighting** (Sun simulation)
   - **Ambient Lighting** for global illumination
   - **Hemisphere Lighting** for sky/ground color bleeding
   - **Shadow Mapping** with PCF soft shadows
   - **Emissive Materials** for glowing effects

### 3. **3D Modeling & Rendering**
   - **Mesh Construction** programmatically generated buildings
   - **Hierarchical Transformations** for complex objects
   - **Material Systems** with Lambert and Basic materials
   - **Backface Culling** and depth testing optimization

### 4. **Animation Systems**
   - **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth 60fps rendering
   - **Delta Time Calculation** for frame-rate independent movement
   - **Procedural Animation** for character and animal movements
   - **Transform Hierarchy** for complex object animations

### 5. **Scene Management**
   - **Object Culling** for performance optimization
   - **Frustum Culling** to avoid rendering off-screen objects
   - **Level of Detail (LOD)** for distant objects
   - **Memory Management** with proper disposal

### 6. **Camera Systems**
   - **Orbit Controls** for intuitive camera movement
   - **Perspective Projection** for 3D depth perception
   - **Camera Frustum** management for optimal rendering

### 7. **Resource Management**
   - **Async Asset Loading** for textures and models
   - **Memory Pooling** for frequently used objects
   - **Garbage Collection** prevention through object reuse
